        <h3>step</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. </li>
            <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. </li>
            <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave. </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
            <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas. </li>
            <li>Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil. </li>
        </ol>
